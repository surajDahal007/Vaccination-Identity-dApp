# About This dAPP
Vaccinated Identity dApp is a decentralized Application that allows users to register their vaccinated details, check vaccination status of another account & allows viewing their own detail. One user is not allowed to view detail of another user.

## Technologies Used
FrontEnd of this project is done in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), whereas smart contract is deployed in [Polygon Mumbai Testnet](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/mumbai-testnet) which is written in solidity. [Ether.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) was used for interaction with testnet. Smart Contract was directly deployed through [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
